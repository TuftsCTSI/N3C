### Concept Mapping (Polina)

### Datavant PPRL (Kyle)
Kyle has attended ~2hrs of instructional meetings in order to incorporate Datavant PPRL software into the new TRDW for the purpose of deduplicating patient data. In ~12hrs of development time, Kyle has worked to set up an SFTP account to the LHB (Regenstrief), draft a script to automate tokenization of N3C cohort, and troubleshoot and tokenize the latest N3C submission using the Datavant software.
