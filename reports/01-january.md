### Device Data Acquisition (Manlik Kwong)

A data capture process is in production in which medical device data such as patient bedside monitors and respirators from different departments, floors, and bed within Tufts Medicine network of hospitals is being used to capture physiological, device settings, and alarm data.
For the N3C project, we have implemented a screening and mapping process and software that runs autonomously to capture and map 2 of 16 different Intensive Care Unit bedside medical devices.
The data captured represents cardiac, respiratory, and general vitals (temperature, heartrate, blood pressures, etc) and parameters.
Data is captured as HL7 transactions in which it is organized by patient, department/floor, device, and reporting period. SNOMED and LOINC mapping are available for the two most common device data sources (Philips iX Central Station and Draeger Medibus).
Over the next quarter over 402,000 HL7 transactions captured since June 2022 will be parsed, mapped, and associated to the next N3C cohort update.
