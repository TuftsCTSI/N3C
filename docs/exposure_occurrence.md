# The Exposure Occurrence Table

The exposure_occurrence table enriches the OMOP CDM by incorporating geospatial data and linking it to individuals and specific time periods within the cohort. It can be integrated with OHDSI tools and infrastructure, and it fits into existing workflows and facilitates geospatial analysis. 

The table schema (Table 1) captures crucial geospatial aspects, enabling studies on the interplay between person-related features and geographical factors. Leveraging the exposure_occurrence table empowers researchers to explore the influence of proximity to environmental exposures or healthcare facilities on disease patterns, healthcare utilization, and treatment outcomes within the OMOP CDM framework.

Exposure in this context refers to the occurrence of exposure to specific factors, substances, or events, that are relevant to medical research, healthcare analytics, and epidemiological studies.
