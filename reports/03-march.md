### OHDSI Environment for N3C (Kyrylo)

Kyrylo attended 1h meeting to discuss deployment of the OHDSI tool stack on the Databricks platform and related compatibility concerns.

### ETL of EHR to OMOP (Kyle)

EHR data is being transformed from the Epic Clarity model to the OMOP CDM specification. Currently, the database contains:

- 3.59 million patients (1.48 million "active" patients)
- 57 million visits
- 92 million measurements

At this point, 709 unique concepts from Tufts' Epic Clarity data have been mapped to vocabularies supported by the OMOP CDM and OHDSI tools.

The ETL of EHR data to OMOP is nearly complete. After a review of ETL data quality, the ETL script will be ready to transform data from EHR to OMOP in production. Concepts will steadily continue to be mapped in order to meet researcher use cases and improve overall ETL quality.
