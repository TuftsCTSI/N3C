## OHDSI Environment for N3C (Kyrylo Simonov)

Kyrylo attended 1h meeting to discuss deployment of the OHDSI tool stack on the Databricks platform and related compatibility concerns.

## Device Data Acquisition (Manlik Kwong)

Updating documentation for medical device data acquisition for OMOP import.

## Concept Mapping (Polina Talapova)

### Deliverables
1. Extended Flowsheets-to-OMOP mapping set in the SSSOM format 
2. Updated version of Python tool for converting mapping in SSSOM to SQL inserts (v.1.1)
3. OMOP CDM ETL Specification Guide
4. Documentation on the asssessment of the i2b2-on-OMOP application potential

### Quantitative Metrics
* Number of meetings within the project per month: 9 (9 hrs)
* Number of shared mapping tables by stakeholders: 5
* Number of files processed to obtain deliverables: 4
* Number of terms mapped to OMOP via SSSOM: (2434)+206
* Number of candidate OMOP Extension concepts to be validated: (37)+30

### Involved Stakeholders
* Internal: Andrew Williams, Marta Alvarez, Manlik Kwong, Kyle Zollo-Venecek, Kevin Auguste, Polina Talapova
* External: Edilberto Amorim De Cerqueira Filho (UCSF), Melanie Philofsky (Odysseus), Dmytry Dymshits (JJ), Piper Ranallo (Fairview Health Services), Jeff Klann (i2b2)  
### Work done and Outcomes
* Developed additional Flowsheets-to-OMOP-via-SSSOM mappings
* Optimized SSSOM-related materials
* Formulated guidelines on how to structure ETL specifications in accordance with OHDSI best practices
* Attended targeted OHDSI Working Groups (Psychiatry, THEMIS, GIS) to evaluate different semantic spaces in the OMOP Vocabulary for gaps identification and ensure compliance with OHDSI strategy
* Initiated assistance for Edilberto in converting UCSF's dataset to OMOP via SSSOM, providing guidance and support throughout the conversion process.
* Initiated review of HPO to OMOP mapping
* Initiated a review of the HPO to OMOP mapping to identify areas for improvement and ensure alignment with established ontology standards
* Provided Manlik with feedback on SSSOM mapping tables that he generated and shared, offering suggestions for improvement and identifying areas where the mappings could be further refine
* Evaluated the potential of the i2b2 application in Tufts projects from the Vocabulary perspective

### Next Steps
* Extend MIMIC4-to-OMOP-via-SSSOM mapping collection by incorporating Manlik's mappings in SSSOM
* Extend Flowsheets-to-OMOP-via-SSSOM mapping collection
* Revise and improve the developed documentation and materials
* Extend collection of candidate OMOP Extension concepts to be added to the OMOP Vocabulary
* Continue working on ECTO incorporation in the OMOP Vocabulary
* Finalize HPO-to-OMOP mapping review and transform mappings in SSSOM format
* Define a strategy for converting data to OMOP via SSSOM based on UCSF materials, leveraging established best practices to ensure accuracy and completeness of the mapping process; provide Edilberto with feedback
